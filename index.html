            <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
                This decade has seen the emergence of many online learning platforms where one or more mentors teach a group of thousands of students. We have found that although learning is now modernised and digitised, the need for individual learning is still not met. Through this survey, we aim to present descriptive statistics on the proportion of students who would prefer individualised learning, and further use this data to research on the effects of online mass education on students.

        <section class="mt-14" id="how-does-this-survey-work">
            <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold">How does this survey work</h3>
            <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
                Through the 6 mandatory questions in the survey, we get to know how often a student has required one-to-one mentorship, and how much they value it, and if they think they would require the same in future.<br><br>
                When we have sufficient entries for this survey, we would then calculate the results by deriving a proportions between students who required a one-to-one mentorship and values it, vs students who requires a one-to-one mentorship but does not values it vs students who never required nor will be requiring it in the future.

            <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
                We would want to describe the data based on demography and educational level since different countries have follow different practices and educational level has also influence the need for individualised learning, hence we are collecting demographic and educational information.
